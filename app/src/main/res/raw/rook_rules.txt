Welcome to ROOK!

This game is a 4 player game in which you will be split into two teams. You will sit across from your team member and you will not be aware of each others hands throughtout the game.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this game is to be the first team to score 300 points by winning "tricks" (rounds).

DISCARD/NEST: Each player receives 9 cards, and 5 cards are set aside for the "nest". The bid winner has the option to select up to 5 of their cards to trade with the cards within the "nest". At the end of the round (end of 9 cards being played), the last team to "take the trick" has the nest added to their score.

BIDDING: You have the option to bid a minimum of 70 points and a maximum of 120 points, or pass. The highest bidder has the chance to trade with the nest and select the trump suit. You should be bidding the amount of points you think your team will win at the end of the round; if you do not reach the bid amount, you do not receive the points from that round and the bid amount is subtracted from your team's total score.

PLAY: The player who "takes the trick" is the first to play their card and, as a result, gets to choose the leading suit for that subround. If you have a card of the leading suit, you must play that card or the Rook bird card; you may only play another card (including the trump suit) if you do not have a card of the leading suit.

POINTS: 5 - 5 points
	10 - 10 points
	14 - 10 points
	Rook - 20 points
